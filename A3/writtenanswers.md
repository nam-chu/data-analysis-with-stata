## Part 2

### Question 1b)
**What is the DID estimate? How do you interpret that number, i.e. what is the change in the price of a meal as measured by your total price variable after the minimum wage is increased?**


- the DID estimate is the coefficient on the interaction variable.
   - .0794417
- Interpretation: For states with an increase in minimum wage, the price of a meal (fries + drink + entree) increased by $0.079 on average as compared to states with no increase in minimum wage. However, the p-value is > 0.05, we cannot say that the result is statistically significant.
